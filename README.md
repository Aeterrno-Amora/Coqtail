# Coqtail
## A Vim Plugin for Interactive Theorem Proving in Coq

Coqtail is a rewrite of
[Coquille](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/coquille).
The main improvements are:
- Better support for editing multiple files simultaneously
- Support for both Python 2 and 3.
- Support for Coq 8.4 - 8.7

Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------
Coqtail can be installed using
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
Follow the setup instructions and then:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/whonore/Coqtail.git

Coqtail requires:
- vim compiled with either +python or +python3
- [vimbufsync](https://github.com/let-def/vimbufsync)
- [Coq 8.4](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-84),
  [8.5](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-85),
  [8.6](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-86), or
  [8.7](https://coq.inria.fr/coq-87)

If you are using pathogen, documentation can be generated by
`:call pathogen#helptags()`. Alternatively, you can do `:helptags
{path-to-coqtail}/doc`.

Usage
-----
Coqtail provides the following commands (see `:help coqtail` for more detail)
- CoqStart - Launches Coq
- CoqStop - Quits Coq
- CoqNext - Submits the next line to Coq for checking
- CoqUndo - Steps back
- CoqToCursor - Submits all lines up to the cursor
- CoqToTop - Resets the checked part to the beginning of the file
- Coq \<arg> - Sends arbitrary commands to Coq (such as Check, About, Print,
  etc)
- JumpToEnd - Moves the cursor to the end of the checked region
- FindDef - Searches the LoadPath for the definition of the word under the
  cursor and opens it in another file if possible
- MakeMatch - Insert a 'match' template for a given Inductive type at the
  cursor location

Coqtail does not set any mappings by default but provides some in the function
`coqtail#Mapping()`, which could be called in your .vimrc.

Coqtail also comes with an ftdetect script for Coq, as well as modified
versions of Vincent Aravantinos'
[syntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2063) and
[index](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2079) scripts for Coq.
